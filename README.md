## Bus Management System 

This project is a **bus management system** designed by a group of students to improve the efficiency and organization of bus operations. It aims to streamline various aspects, including:

* **Driver and conductor management:** Record and manage driver and conductor details, including registration numbers, names, and other relevant information.
* **Shift management:** Schedule and track driver and conductor shifts, ensuring proper staff assignments and coverage.
* **Route management:** Define and manage bus routes, including stops, schedules, and fares.
* **Data recording:** Store data about bus schedules, drivers, conductors, and other relevant details.

**Technologies:**

* Programming language: Java, UI designs using Java Swing, SQL
* IDE: NetBeans
* RDBMS: MySQL

**Target Audience:**

This project can be valuable for:

* **Bus companies:** Simplify operations, improve data management, and gain insights into their bus network.
* **Educational institutions:** Manage transportation for students and staff, potentially with additional features like student tracking.
* **Other organizations:** Any organization that utilizes a fleet of buses for transportation management.

**Current Stage of Development:**

* All the functions are working. But needed further development.
* Need to implement data validations for some parts as well as proper exception handling.
* Database is not normalized.

**Installation Guidelines:**
